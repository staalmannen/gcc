NEED:
find

gmake:
gmake configure needs a --localedir option (set it to /sys/lib/gnu/locale).  or make it obey --datadir
remember to add it in i18n directory
changed gettext.c to fix a bug
configure script broken (old autoconf bug; run autoconf-2.50)
config.guess, config.sub taught about Plan 9

(gnu)-APE:
putenv bug fixed
time() made to use pread
install script changed.

m4:
fix configure file
provide for setting of bindir (or manually edit Makefiles)
needs to check for mktemp in -lbsd (temp added to Makefile)

autoconf, automake:
should put portable scripts under /rc/bin/... (and only build once for an installall)

texinfo:
updated config.guess, config.sub
it wants to create links :-(
hacked config.status to not make link.  copied file by hand.
further problems.  installed makeinfo by itself.  doesn't work.

binutils:
update config.guess, config.sub
complete list of modified files in binutils-2.11.2/plan9-files
run auto*, aclocal a lot
see gettext
have to hit return a few times during build!  'shell for | sort' is blocking on stdin!
using gettext doesn't seem to work; binutils still wants to use its own.
went back to an old configure script for intl directory for now
todo: fix a.outx.h
removed all stabs of type N_GSYM in obj-plan9.c; investigate this further later

gcc:

gdb:
? partial-stab.h

gettext:
update config.guess, config.sub
using latest version since the one supplied with binutils has problems
it doesn't work either :-(
major bandaids applied; bind true to various /bin/a*
changed decl of strcasecmp for gnu
2 long file names, breaks man
created env script
